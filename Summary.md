## Introduction ##

Aim of the project  is to provide selective compression utilities for Java (that are not available in pure Java).


## Status ##
It is still in alpha stage. Though sample program for compressing/decompressing zero-filled-data/random-data works fine.


## Details ##
At present pure Java implementation of LZO is supported.
